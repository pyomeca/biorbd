  abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force\textendash length\textendash velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force\textendash length\textendash velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested.},

  abstract = {Existing algorithms for estimating muscle forces mainly use least-activation criteria, which do not necessarily lead to physiologically consistent results. Our objective was to assess an innovative forward dynamics-based optimisation, assisted by both electromyography (EMG) and marker tracking, for estimating the upper-limb muscle forces. A reference movement was generated, and EMG was simulated to reproduce the desired joint kinematics. Random noise was added to both simulated EMG and marker trajectories in order to create 30 trials. Then, muscle forces were estimated using (1) the innovative EMG-marker tracking forward optimisation, (2) a marker tracking forward optimisation with a least-excitation criterion, and (3) static optimisation with a least-activation criterion. Approaches (1) and (2) were solved using a direct multiple shooting algorithm. Finally, reference and estimated joint angles and muscle forces for the three optimisations were statistically compared using root-mean-square errors (RMSEs), biases, and statistical parametric mapping. The joint angles RMSEs were qualitatively similar across the three optimisations: (1) 1.63{$\pm$}0.51\$1.63 \textbackslash pm 0.51\$\textdegree; (2) 2.02{$\pm$}0.64\$2.02 \textbackslash pm 0.64\$\textdegree; (3) 0.79{$\pm$}0.38\$0.79 \textbackslash pm 0.38\$\textdegree. However, the muscle forces RMSE for the EMG-marker tracking optimisation (20.39{$\pm$}13.24\$20.39 \textbackslash pm 13.24\$~N) was about seven times smaller than those resulting from the marker tracking (124.22{$\pm$}118.22\$124.22 \textbackslash pm 118.22\$~N) and static (148.15{$\pm$}94.01\$148.15 \textbackslash pm 94.01\$~N) optimisations. The originality of this novel approach is close tracking of both simulated EMG and marker trajectories in the same objective function, using forward dynamics. Therefore, the presented EMG-marker tracking optimisation led to accurate muscle forces estimations.},

This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called ``visco-elasticity'' of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the ``visco-elastic'' properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

  abstract = {For many clinical applications it is necessary to non-invasively determine shoulder motion during dynamic movements, and in such cases skin markers are favoured. However, as skin markers may not accurately track the underlying bone motion the methods currently used must be refined. Furthermore, to determine the motion of the shoulder a model is required to relate the obtained marker trajectories to the shoulder kinematics. In Wu et al. (2005) the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) proposed a shoulder model based on the position of bony landmarks. A limitation of the ISB recommendations is that the reference positions of the shoulder joints are not standardized. The aims of this research project were to develop a method to accurately determine shoulder kinematics using skin markers, and to investigate the effect of introduction of a standardized reference configuration. Fifteen subjects, free from shoulder pathology, performed arm elevations while skin marker trajectories were tracked. Shoulder kinematics were reconstructed using a chain model and extended Kalman filter. The results revealed significant differences between the kinematics obtained with and without introduction of the reference configuration. The curves of joint angle tended towards 0\textdegree{} for 0\textdegree{} of humerus elevation when the reference configuration was introduced. In conclusion, the shoulder kinematics obtained with introduction of the reference configuration were found to be easier to interpret than those obtained without introduction of the reference configuration.},

In contrast, musculoskeletal modelling approaches use Inverse Kinematics (IK) to obtain joint angles. IK allows additional analysis (e.g. muscle-tendon length estimates), which may provide valuable information for clinical decision-making in people with movement disorders. The twofold aims of the current study were: (1) to compare joint kinematics obtained by a clinical DK model (Vicon Plug-in-Gait) with those produced by a widely used IK model (available with the OpenSim distribution), and (2) to evaluate the difference in joint kinematics that can be solely attributed to the different computational methods (DK versus IK), anatomical models and marker sets by using MRI based models. Eight children with cerebral palsy were recruited and presented for gait and MRI data collection sessions. Differences in joint kinematics up to 13\textdegree{} were found between the Plug-in-Gait and the gait 2392 OpenSim model. The majority of these differences (94.4\%) were attributed to differences in the anatomical models, which included different anatomical segment frames and joint constraints. Different computational methods (DK versus IK) were responsible for only 2.7\% of the differences. We recommend using the same anatomical model for kinematic and musculoskeletal analysis to ensure consistency between the obtained joint angles and musculoskeletal estimates.},

Muscle activation levels in lower limb were compared between the packages, and against the electromyography signals from the aforementioned competitions. The muscle activation levels were very similar between the two packages when matched models were simulated, indicating high consistency between the solvers. In the generic models, the root mean square (RMS) difference in the muscle activation levels was high at 0.15 and 0.19 for ideal force generator muscles and modified Hill-type muscles, respectively. The RMS and phase differences were high between the muscle activations and electromyography signals.

The system is general to non-human morphologies and results in natural balancing motions employing the entire body (for example, wind-milling). Our novel balance routine seeks to control the linear and angular momenta of the character. We demonstrate how momentum is related to the center of mass and center of pressure of the character and derive control rules to change these centers for balance. The desired momentum changes are reconciled with the objective of tracking the reference motion through an optimization routine which produces target joint accelerations. A hybrid inverse/forward dynamics algorithm determines joint torques based on these joint accelerations and the ground reaction forces. Finally, the joint torques are applied to the free-standing character simulation. We demonstrate results for following both motion capture and keyframe data as well as both human and non-human morphologies in presence of a variety of conditions and disturbances.},

The one-parameter A-model is easy to implement, and when used with an EMG-driven Hill-type model, was shown to provide a better fit of the measured joint moment.

  abstract = {In the context of neuro-orthopedic pathologies affecting walking and thus patients' quality of life, understanding the mechanisms of gait deviations and identifying the causal motor impairments is of primary importance. Beside other approaches, neuromusculoskeletal simulations may be used to provide insight into this matter. To the best of our knowledge, no computational framework exists in the literature that allows for predictive simulations featuring muscle co-contractions, and the introduction of various types of perturbations during both healthy and pathological gait types. The aim of this preliminary study was to adapt a recently proposed EMG-marker tracking optimization process to a lower limb musculoskeletal model during equinus gait, a multiphase problem with contact forces. The resulting optimization method tracking EMG, ground reactions forces and marker trajectories allowed an accurate reproduction of joint kinematics (average error of 5.4 {$\pm$} 3.3 mm for pelvis translations, and 1.9 {$\pm$} 1.3\textdegree{} for pelvis rotation and joint angles) and ensured good temporal agreement in muscle activity (the concordance between estimated and measured excitations was 76.8 {$\pm$} 5.3 \%) in a relatively fast process (3.88 {$\pm$} 1.04 h). We have also highlighted that the tracking of ground reaction forces was possible and accurate (average error of 17.3 {$\pm$} 5.5 N), even without the use of a complex foot-ground contact model.},

  abstract = {A variety of musculoskeletal models are applied in different modelling environments for estimating muscle forces during gait. Influence of different modelling assumptions and approaches on model outputs are still not fully understood, while direct comparisons of standard approaches have been rarely undertaken. This study seeks to compare joint kinematics, joint kinetics and estimated muscle forces of two standard approaches offered in two different modelling environments (AnyBody, OpenSim). It is hypothesised that distinctive differences exist for individual muscles, while summing up synergists show general agreement. Experimental data of 10 healthy participants (28 {$\pm$} 5 years, 1.72 {$\pm$} 0.08 m, 69 {$\pm$} 12 kg) was used for a standard static optimisation muscle force estimation routine in AnyBody and OpenSim while using two gait-specific musculoskeletal models. Statistical parameter mapping paired t-test was used to compare joint angle, moment and muscle force waveforms in Matlab. Results showed differences especially in sagittal ankle and hip angles as well as sagittal knee moments. Differences were also found for some of the muscles, especially of the triceps surae group and the biceps femoris short head, which occur as a result of different anthropometric and anatomical definitions (mass and inertia of segments, muscle properties) and scaling procedures (static vs. dynamic). Understanding these differences and their cause is crucial to operate such modelling environments in a clinical setting. Future research should focus on alternatives to classical generic musculoskeletal models (e.g. implementation of functional calibration tasks), while using experimental data reflecting normal and pathological gait to gain a better understanding of variations and divergent behaviour between approaches.},

  abstract = {Piano performance involves several levels of motor abundancy. Identification of kinematic strategies that enhance performance and reduce risks of practice-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMD) represents an important research topic since more than half of professional pianists might suffer from PRMD during their career. Studies in biomechanics have highlighted the benefits of using proximal upper-limb joints to reduce the load on distal segments by effectively creating velocity and force at the finger-key interaction. If scientific research has documented postural and expressive features of pianists' trunk motion, there is currently a lack of scientific evidence assessing the role of trunk motion in sound-production and in injury prevention. We address this gap by integrating motion of the pelvis and thorax in the analysis of both upper-limb linear velocities and joint angular contribution to endpoint velocities. Specifically, this study aims to assess kinematic features of different types of touch and articulation and the impact of trunk motion on these features. Twelve pianists performed repetitive loud and slow-paced keystrokes. They were asked to vary: i) body implication (use of trunk and upper limb motion or use of only upper limb motion), ii) touch (struck touch, initiating the attack with the fingertip at a certain distance from the key surface, or pressed touch, initiating the attack with the fingertip in contact with the key surface), and iii) articulation (staccato, short finger-key contact time, or tenuto, sustained finger-key contact time). Data were collected using a 3D motion capture system and a sound recording device. Results show that body implication, touch, and articulation modified kinematic features of loud keystrokes, which exhibited not only downward but also important forward segmental velocities (particularly in pressed touch and staccato articulation). Pelvic anterior rotation had a prominent role in the production of loud tones as it effectively contributed to create forward linear velocities at the upper limb. The reported findings have implications for performance, teaching and research domains since they provide evidence of how pianists' trunk motion can actively contribute to the sound-production and might not only be associated with either postural or expressive features.},

Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance.
